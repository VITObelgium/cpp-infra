OPAQ - Operational prediction of air quality

OPAQ is a runtime framework for operational prediction of air quality, both forecast as well as mapping.
The package uses the GNU autotools built system, when checking out, please first run the
autogen.sh script to add the build structure. After that just ./configure; make; make install.

Prerequisites
*************

The prequisites can be compiled by calling
bootstrap.sh on linux
bootstrap.bat on windows

This will build all third party libraries required by OPAQ
The libraries will be located in build/deps/local

Third party libraries:
- Spdlog logging facilities
- Eigen3 matrix library
- HDF5 hdf5 utilities


Compilation & debugging
***********************
OPAQ uses cmake which should make the compilation process fairly straight forward

By calling build.sh on linux or build.bat on windows the OPAQ project is compiled.
Make sure to call the bootstrap script first.

build/opaq will be the build directory, use it for incremental builds after you make changes.
