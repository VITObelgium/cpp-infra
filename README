OPAQ - Operational prediction of air quality

OPAQ is a runtime framework for operational prediction of air quality, both forecast as well as mapping.
The package uses the GNU autotools built system, when checking out, please first run the
autogen.sh script to add the build structure. After that just ./configure; make; make install. 

Prerequisites  
*************

OPAQ used a number of 3th party libraries for matrix algebra, logging and storage. 
- Log4cxx
- Eigen3, the configure script checks for eigen3/Eigen/Dense
- HDF5, note that we need the H5Cpp bindinges for OPAQ, so be sure this is installed !

Under Ubunutu, you can install the development sources with : 

sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev libhdf5-dev libhdf5-serial-dev libhdf5-7 \
                     liblog4cxx10 liblog4cxx10-dev

OPAQ was tested with 
- log4cxx 0.10.0
- Eigen 3.2.0
- HDF5 1.8, note that the C++ bindings need to be present, this is checked inthe configure script

Note that with some configuation options in the configure script such as --with-Eigen, 
you can specify a non-default path to Eigen.


Compilation & debugging
*********************** 
OPAQ uses the GNU autotools, which should make the compilation process fairly straight forward. There is a
debugging configuration, which enables debugging symbols and turns of optimization. Turn it on using

./configure --enable-debug=yes 

Compilation of the main code requires the HDF5 C++ library, as some tools are present to facilitate
using this format in the plugin code. The configure script checks for the presence of the library,
alternatively you can specify it's location using 

./configure --with-hdf5=/full/path/to/bin/h5cc

note that at runtime, you'll have to make sure to run with the samen HDF5 shared library

Also for the Eigen libaray, needed to e.g. compile the forecast plugins, you can specify the location of
the Eigen include folder (typically labeled "Eigen" via

./configure --with-Eigen=/path/to/Eigen
