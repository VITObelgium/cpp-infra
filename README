OPAQ - Operational prediction of air quality

OPAQ is a runtime framework for operational prediction of air quality, both forecast as well as mapping.
The package uses the GNU autotools built system, when checking out, please first run the
autogen.sh script to add the build structure. After that just ./configure; make; make install.

Prerequisites
*************

The prequisites can be compiled by calling the bootstrap script.

On linux:
call bootstrap.sh and select the desired configuration

On windows:
call bootstrap.bat, it will build both debug and release versions of the prerequisites

This will build all third party libraries required by OPAQ
The libraries will be located in build/deps/local

Third party libraries:
- Spdlog logging facilities
- Eigen3 matrix library
- HDF5 hdf5 utilities

Compilation & debugging
***********************
OPAQ uses cmake which should make the compilation process fairly straight forward.
Use the build scripts to perform the cmake configuration and initial build.

On linux:
call build.sh and select the desired configuration
build/opaq_[config] will be the build directory, use it for incremental builds after you make changes.

On windows:
call build.bat, it will generate a visual studio solution and perform an initial build
build/opaq will contain the visual studio solution, use it for development

Make sure to call the bootstrap script first.
