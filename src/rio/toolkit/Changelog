RIO Matlab Toolkit

Authors: Jef Hooyberghs

v2.0 : - made the toolkit compatible with the FORTRAN XML setup file...
		 
v1.5 : - added rio_map and rio_display routines
       - enabled log transformation
	   - new rio validation routine with validation viewer, needs the validation 
	     toolkit under svn://sublime.vito.local/KWL/RMA/MatlabToolkit/trunk
	   - added long term support stuff in the xml setup file as some separate
	     configurations
	   - update of the OptimizeGUI routine where we have added an optimisation mode
	     which maximizes the spatial correlation
	   - added trend analysis tools (scripts from RIO 2012 project)
	   - added tools to import SVPOL
	   - updated the postprocessor to deal with hdf5 data, which the validation tool 
	     now also spits out...
	   - added an obsolete folder to archive old, obsolete code
	     
				 
				 
v1.4 : - restructured the configuration paths, now always separated in
         pollutant subfolders, structure : 
         ./drivers/<pol>
         ./data/<pol>
         ./param/<pol>/trend
         ./param/<pol>/stat_param
         ./param/<pol>/spatial_corr
         ./drivers/<pol>
         ./stations/<pol>

         replaced the land_use folder with the generic name 'drivers' and
         the rio_param is now just param for cosmetic reasons. 

       - a new xml file now sets the paths to the configuration files
         separately per folder, so no more base-path crap and hard coded
         folder names to form the path of e.g. a trend function file

       - routine rio_setup replaces rio_init, which is now obsolete.
       - rio_log now writes to current working folder instead of base path
	   - adjusted the utils a little, only the OptimizeGUI etc are still not
	     compatible
        

v1.3 : - added maphdf5 (iguess)
       - ???

v1.2 : - rewritten some documentation for each routine
       - added rio_version & startup.m
			 - made rio.m compatible with fortran, in the sense that it is able to directly
			   ingest ascii files e.g. pm10_data_rio.txt like the fortran version. Slightly
				 altered the rio_createdb routine for this by adding an additional argument which 
				 controls whether to save the parsed concentration data to disk (mat file) or 
				 attach it to the cnf strcuture. 
				 
v1.1 : - added clc06d spatial driver in rio_avgtrend
       - added possibility to exclude stations from trend fitting
			 - added several tools : optimisatoin, data stripper
			 - reorganized the utils folder, moved rio.m and riopp.m to main 
			 - added the OptimizeGUI folder to the svn
			 - all utilities have commont structure now
			 

				 
v1.0 : - first stable release, used for rioNH3 and RIO 2009 project
